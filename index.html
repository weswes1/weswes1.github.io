  A young boy turns into a man.
  Eighteen. Nineteen maybe between twenty or thirty
  believe me, my mind is not dirty, but pure
  and clean like an infant's. Scant earnings,
  but spiritually rich, ditch the paper chase
  what lies within a coin, nothing but 
  special configurations of atoms, gold, steel, iron, 
  used to make sirens that blast through the night. 
  mine the might of the earth,
  shine lights of minerals, 
  copper carries electrons energized,
  over and across doves long limbs curl 
  around cold cords, wires cables
  carrying electric ectasy, life, particles rush under
 pink tissue, undulating intenstinal, gripping tows
  buzzing with illness. who who who-------
  Allahu Akbar
  
  
  
  I said yo its G man, 
  pass that can, of whatever
  you got, i'll gulp it down
  yeah you'll catch me around,
  downtown cruising slow on the
  8 speed, maybe puffing definitely
  sayin whassup to a g man g man
  
  G man
  
  Yo it's G man here to stay
  here to take your pain away
  Yo its G man here to stay 
  here to take your pain away
  Find me chilling by the bay
  all way the down shattuck
  I bike to jobs and complete
  haters made obsolete
  throw a toss take a loss
  Yo yo yo it's G man here to stay
  here to take your pain away
  
  僕、「ジーマンだ」言った.僕達はバスケットボールをしていた。
  
  ジーマンがバースケットボールコートに来た。
  
  ジーマン、何のために来たか？僕、彼に、聞いた。
  
  「痛みを捨てるのために」ヨージーマン言った
  
  ジーマンが一手でバスケットボールを打ち込んだ
  
  スーヲーっっっっシュシュシュシュシュシュシュシュ
  
　バスケットボールが下に行っていた。
  
  完璧な三。
  
   もう一回。 ジーマン、何のために来たか？僕、彼に、聞いた。
  
  「痛みを捨てるのために」ヨージーマン言った
  
  IT'S NOW-A-CLOCK!!! I shouted, as the ball went
  swoo-oo-shh Behind the back left handed swoosh
  from outer space don't waste time, rhyme, shoot
  you know you want to, man, you know you want to man
  you know you want to, man, you wknow you want to man,
  take two, three, maybe four
  you know I'm gonna score
  don't boast be honest like Abe 
  Lincoln baby son? Don't have one 
  but if I did I'd yell IT'S NOW-A-ClOCK!!!
  Romance and circumstance
  Inhale life, strife
  Reflect, connect
  missing pieces
  
  I said, YO, as I strode up to the court and sunk a one handed three, setting my backpack down on the bench.
  The three players in front of me look astonished 
  The ball hit the ground, check ball.
  No stalls in my game pure stamina, sure to sweat
  don't bet against me odds are you'll lose
  too smooth for the news, ladies I choose from a 
  wide selection, I'm a candidate for election
  an erection or a sign of male ferility,
