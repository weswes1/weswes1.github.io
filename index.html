  IT'S NOW-A-CLOCK!!! I shouted, as the ball went
  swoo-oo-shh Behind the back left handed swoosh
  from outer space don't waste time, rhyme, shoot
  you know you want to, man, you know you want to man
  you know you want to, man, you wknow you want to man,
  take two, three, maybe four
  you know I'm gonna score
  don't boast be honest like Abe 
  Lincoln baby son? Don't have one 
  but if I did I'd yell IT'S NOW-A-ClOCK!!!
  Romance and circumstance
  Inhale life, strife
  Reflect, connect
  missing pieces
