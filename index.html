 The man waited patiently. Life was unfolding before him. 
 He had to move, accomplish something, earn some money, do something, anything. 
 Or else, slow starvation and death would come for him. 
 Homelessness in a city with bitter cold nights. 
 I can complete the task in front of me, I can complete the task in front of me. 
 I can do it, I can do it. He said to himself.
 Yes, the task is daunting. Yes the task is difficult. 
 Yes, the task is a source of worry and concern for me. 
 But I can do it
