  The girl dumped him but it became clear over time that it was her loss
  He came to know his worth as a true boss.
  Even though he still loved her and was heart broken for years,
  the wound eventually healed and he became gay like a happy rainbow queer.
  He was humble in nature and spirit as a god connected light being.
  He disavowed whores in the pursuit of angelic beings.
  Seeing none, yet believing in the unseen spiritual world.
  All of its entities, both demonic and angelic.
  Remember, the war between good and evil rages within and without.
  Remember, all of this world is an illusion and none of it is real.
  He broke his two week nofap streak and was sad for a few days 
  but recovered. He won't give up as he knows bliss is his to claim.
  
     
     
  A young boy turns into a man.
  Eighteen. Nineteen maybe between twenty or thirty
  believe me, my mind is not dirty, but pure
  and clean like an infant's. Scant earnings,
  but spiritually rich, ditch the paper chase
  what lies within a coin, nothing but 
  special configurations of atoms, gold, steel, iron, 
  used to make sirens that blast through the night. 
  mine the might of the earth,
  shine lights of minerals, 
  copper carries electrons energized,
  over and across doves long limbs curl 
  around cold cords, wires cables
  carrying electric ectasy, life, particles rush under
 pink tissue, undulating intenstinal, gripping tows
  buzzing with illness. who who who-------
  Allahu Akbar
  
  
  
  I said yo its G man,

  here to take your pain away

     The ocean is lonely and
     wants to bless your soul with love, salt 
     that has gone up and down upon waves 
     from africa, from the ivory coasts.
     paranoia evades those who percieve 
     the soft flap of leaves in the air
     
  
  IT'S NOW-A-CLOCK!!! I shouted, as the ball went
  swoo-oo-shh Behind the back left handed swoosh
  from outer space don't waste time, rhyme, shoot
  you know you want to, man, you know you want to man
  take two, three, maybe four
  you know I'm gonna score
  don't boast be honest like Abe 
  Lincoln baby son? Don't have one 
  but if I did I'd yell IT'S NOW-A-ClOCK!!!
  Romance and circumstance
  Inhale life, strife
  Reflect, connect
  missing pieces
  
  I said, YO, as I strode up to the court and sunk a one handed three, setting my backpack down on the bench.
  The three players in front of me looked astonished 
  The ball hit the ground, check ball.
  No stalls in my game pure stamina, sure to sweat
  don't bet against me odds are you'll lose
  too smooth for the news, ladies I choose from a 
  wide selection, I'm a candidate for election
  an erection or a sign of male ferility,
