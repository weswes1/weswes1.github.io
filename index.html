  G man
  
  Yo it's G man here to stay
  here to take your pain away
  Yo its G man here to stay 
  here to take your pain away
  Find me chilling by the bay
  all wy the down gillman street
  I bike to jobs and complete
  haters made obsolete
  throw a toss take a loss
  Yo yo yo it's G man here to stay
  here to take your pain away
  
  
  
  IT'S NOW-A-CLOCK!!! I shouted, as the ball went
  swoo-oo-shh Behind the back left handed swoosh
  from outer space don't waste time, rhyme, shoot
  you know you want to, man, you know you want to man
  you know you want to, man, you wknow you want to man,
  take two, three, maybe four
  you know I'm gonna score
  don't boast be honest like Abe 
  Lincoln baby son? Don't have one 
  but if I did I'd yell IT'S NOW-A-ClOCK!!!
  Romance and circumstance
  Inhale life, strife
  Reflect, connect
  missing pieces
