 <h2>H2 Header Poem
 
 I am proficient in html and coding, I said  to the hiring manager.
  Not the hiring manager per say, the entrepaneur, restaranteur.
  Well, he grumbled, we are looking for someone with more...
  Experience in software. Not hard? Wares? I have them downstairs.
  With my two other round wares. Hares, I rarely eat them. He did
  not get the joke, it went right over his head. The other lead Stanford
  Engineers, two french queers, had the idea of an autonomous shipping system.
  Well, to those blokes, I say, Frexit!, Brexit!, What's a ship without a captain?
  A wandering vessel, nothing more nothing less. What a mess, a floating piece of rubbish,
  On the contraty, Mr. Contreras, You are mistaken! At fault, for we are the engineers,
  he is the entrepeneur, and, you are simply an HTML coder! Fine I said, to the startup
  garage techies, gay san franciscans! I will be astute with friar franciscans! With,
  I say, this dear may, ash wednesday, near the bay, in the missions along the coast,
  with no pedophilic hush money, like used by the former president or the famous,
  anuse! Not a noose!, Anus, the famous anus

 <h1>Epic of D'vore, Day Vhor Ay--</h1>
 
 
 
 
 <p>
  The idle bloke brought his bag humbly to the feet of the museum curator
  It has been my childhood dream to work here, sir, he said.
  Leonardo Di'Caprio's eyes loomed overhead, silently judging his every mistep.
  Leonardo Da Vinci, da Di, Di Da, Dida, My Friend Dida, I once knew him,
  he was mauled by a black cougar in the swamps of the gambia
  No, it's not a gambia, it is THE gambia, not to be confused with
  any other gambias. A thin slice of rich african pie. Cancaaa luuhvs sugahh.
  Another line I've copied pasted into my ongoing epic poem, the last was,
  "anthrax found inside of a dead cow", not a good, five dollar lunch burger,
  I would much prefer the seasoned horse of Jack in the Hole, Wack a mole,
  he played at Dave and Buss boys rushed past as he came in his pants,
  the diahhear oozed down his leg as he joyfully smashed the buttons on the oily
  controller, at walmart, the oily, controller on the once pristine playstation 
  </p>
 <p>Devore is a bloke I met, homeless
    Surely, another black homeless,
    The amazon black voices resounded with 
    Netflix's Black History month to elude the racist
    white man. White voices, he murmured, mathematically
     Unintelligble nonsense, sounded the judge, from his stand,
 Banging his gauntlet on the high chair. 
 I will be marry, and married, he grumbled, after a burp,
 Quite, said the queen, to the king's hand, Jacob,
 Mahem, bethlehem, Medina, Mecca, Angor Wat, Stalin, Mauling
 Doberman Pinchers, like a crab's right hook
 strait flush, a knockout to the computer's lonely audience.
 Only one time instagram dopamine rush websters here,
 Websters, prankster, wanker, an internet troll bent on

  <h1>Yao Ming Sky Hook</h1>
 <p> Have you heard of the Yao Ming skyhood, said the popular boy.
  No, ahoy, ahoy, pirate bat's cove is starboard.
  A star board? That is the dome, the bowl of the celestial soup?
  Indeed so, I want to dive into it, emaerge from it, deprive myself
  and engorge myself with it, mitt, didn't have a pump.
  Drink beer, watch sports, and be merry, only to become 
  only to become, like all, becoming, becoming </p>

 <p>Chaosing mischief on the world wide playboy, holding a toy cup filled with chinese silk road opium dem silk.</p>
