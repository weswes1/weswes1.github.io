 <h1>Epic of D'vore, Day Vhor Ay--</h1>
 <p>Devore is a bloke I met, homeless
    Surely, another black homeless,
    The amazon black voices resounded with 
    Netflix's Black History month to elude the racist
    white man. White voices, he murmured, mathematically
     Unintelligble nonsense, sounded the judge, from his stand,
 Banging his gauntlet on the high chair. 
 I will be marry, and married, he grumbled, after a burp,
 Quite, said the queen, to the king's hand, Jacob,
 Mahem, bethlehem, Medina, Mecca, Angor Wat, Stalin, Mauling
 Doberman Pinchers, like a crab's right hook
 strait flush, a knockout to the computer's lonely audience.
 Only one time instagram dopamine rush websters here,
 Websters, prankster, wanker, an internet troll bent on
 </p>
 <p>Chaosing mischief on the world wide playboy, holding a toy cup filled with chinese silk road opium dem silk.</p>
