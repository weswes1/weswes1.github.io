 <h1>Epic of D'vore, Day Vhor Ay--</h1>
 
 
 
 
 <p>
  The idle bloke brought his bag humbly to the feet of the museum curator
  It has been my childhood dream to work here, sir, he said.
  Leonardo Di'Caprio's eyes loomed overhead, silently judging his every mistep.
  Leonardo Da Vinci, da Di, Di Da, Dida, My Friend Dida, I once knew him,
  he was mauled by a black cougar in the swamps of the gambia
  No, it's not a gambia, it is THE gambia, not to be confused with
  any other gambias. A thin slice of rich african pie. Cancaaa luuhvs sugahh.
  Another line I've copied pasted into my ongoing epic poem, the last was,
  "anthrax found inside of a dead cow", not a good, five dollar lunch burger,
  I would much prefer the seasoned horse of Jack in the Hole, Wack a mole,
  he played at Dave and Buss boys rushed past as he came in his pants,
  the diahhear oozed down his leg as he joyfully smashed the buttons on the oily
  controller, at walmart, the oily, controller on the once pristine playstation 
  </p>
 <p>Devore is a bloke I met, homeless
    Surely, another black homeless,
    The amazon black voices resounded with 
    Netflix's Black History month to elude the racist
    white man. White voices, he murmured, mathematically
     Unintelligble nonsense, sounded the judge, from his stand,
 Banging his gauntlet on the high chair. 
 I will be marry, and married, he grumbled, after a burp,
 Quite, said the queen, to the king's hand, Jacob,
 Mahem, bethlehem, Medina, Mecca, Angor Wat, Stalin, Mauling
 Doberman Pinchers, like a crab's right hook
 strait flush, a knockout to the computer's lonely audience.
 Only one time instagram dopamine rush websters here,
 Websters, prankster, wanker, an internet troll bent on
 </p>
 
  <h1>Yao Ming Sky Hook</h1>
 <p> Have you heard of the Yao Ming skyhood, said the popular boy.
  No, ahoy, ahoy, pirate bat's cove is starboard.
  A star board? That is the dome, the bowl of the celestial soup?
  Indeed so, I want to dive into it, emaerge from it, deprive myself
  and engorge myself with it, mitt, didn't have a pump.
  Drink beer, watch sports, and be merry, only to become 
  only to become, like all, becoming, becoming </p>

 <p>Chaosing mischief on the world wide playboy, holding a toy cup filled with chinese silk road opium dem silk.</p>
